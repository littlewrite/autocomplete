# Contributing to Autocomplete for Dart

Thanks for taking the time to build out the future of the terminal with us! 🥳

We want to make contributing to Fig as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug

- Submitting feature requests

- Contributing content or feature changes

## Our repos

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Here are some of our primary repos.

[withfig/autocomplete](https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete): Collection of all specs for [autocomplete](https://fig.io/docs/autocomplete). Contribute new specs and update old specs here.

[littlewrite/autocomplete](https://github.com/littlewrite/autocomplete): Fork of [autocomplete](https://fig.io/docs/autocomplete). Complete the conversion from TypeScript to Dart here, fix problems, and refine details.


## Contributing your own spec

The [autocomplete docs](https://fig.io/docs/autocomplete) should get you up to speed on how to write a spec and serve as a good reference.

A few things to keep in mind when writing your spec:

- Ensure that the argument field is filled for subcommands and options when an argument is required.
- Make sure all generators are written with valid Dart.

## Bug reports and feature requests

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs as well as new feature requests. If you have any input, [open a new issue](https://github.com/littlewrite/autocomplete)!
